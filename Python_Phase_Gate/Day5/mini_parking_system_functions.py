"""
=> This program represents a car park as rows and columns.
=> Each of the row is the line for parking car while the column is the specific position where the car is parked in a specific line.
=> In the car park, an empty space is 0 while a space parked with a car is 1.
=> Create a function to check if there is space in the car park or not.
=> Create a function that displays all the available spaces in the car park.
=> A user can specify the specific position they want, and if the position is available: The car is parked; else: "This space is not available."
=> A car can enter the parking lot if thereâ€™s a free slot. The car enters at the first available space from the right. If there is no free space, it should display: "There is no vailable space."
=> Also a car can leave the parking lot by specifying the specific slot position.
=> There should also be a function that allows the user to exit the program.
=> Arrange all the functions into cases to ensure easy navigation for the user.
